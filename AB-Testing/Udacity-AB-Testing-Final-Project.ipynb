    "This is the final project of the online course [Udacity A/B Testing by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257). In this project, let's consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. Let me walk you through about how to design the experiment, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment. The [project instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1aCquhIqsUApgsxQ8-SQBAigFDcfWVVohLEXcV6jWbdI/pub) contain more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"overview\">1.1 Experiment Overview</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the detailed overview in above instruction link, here let me introduce it briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: **start free trial**, and **access course materials**. If the student clicks **start free trial**, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks **access course materials**, they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changes that require A/B Testing\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked **start free trial**, they saw a pop up modal that asked them how much time they had available to devote to the course. The critical value was 5 hours:\n",
    "- If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. \n",
    "- If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screenshot below shows what the experiment looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Udacity-AB-Testing-UI-Change.png\" style=\"width: 70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the flow diagrams:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Udacity-AB-Testing-User-Flow.png\" style=\"width: 70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time—without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"dataset\">1.2 Datasets</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Rough Estimates of the Baseline Values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0): This spreadsheet contains rough estimates of the baseline values, we are going to use it for pre-test analysis, in other words, we will design the A/B test based on its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Test Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu5u9GrybDdska-ljPXyBjTpdZIUev_6i7t4LRDfXM8/edit#gid=0): This spreadsheet contains the test results, we are going to analyze it to decide if the change has any effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id=\"design\">3. Experiment Design</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the instructions, the unit of diversion of this experiment is a **cookie**, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step is to figure out the **Invariant Metrics** and **Evaluation Metrics**. The following are the possible metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of cookies**: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min} = 3000$)\n",
    "- **Number of user-ids**: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. ($d_{min} = 50$)\n",
    "- **Number of clicks**: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). ($d_{min} = 240$)\n",
    "- **Click-through-probability**: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min} = 0.01$)\n",
    "- **Gross conversion**: That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. ($d_{min} = 0.01$)\n",
    "- **Retention**: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of user-ids to complete checkout. ($d_{min} = 0.01$)\n",
    "- **Net conversion**: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. ($d_{min} = 0.0075$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"invariant\">3.1 Choosing Invariant Metrics</a>\n",
    "Invariant metrics shouldn’t change because of the experiment change, so we must select metrics that happen before the experiment change is trigger. In other words, the good invariant metrics are those happen before seeing the pop up modal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the table of those metrics and their baseline values:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Invariant Metric|Formula|$d_{min}$|Baseline Value|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|Number of cookies|$C_{cookies}$ = # of unique cookies to view the course overview page|3000 |40000|\n",
    "|Number of clicks|$C_{clicks}$ = # of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button|240 |3200|\n",

    "### <a id=\"evaluation\">3.2 Choosing Evaluation Metrics</a>\n",
    "In contrast to invariant metrics, evaluation metrics will be affected by the change of experiment and vary between control and treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the table of those evaluation metrics and their baseline values:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Metric|<p align=\"left\">Formula</p>|dmin|Baseline Value|\n",

    "|Net Conversion|<p align=\"left\">$\\displaystyle{NC = }\\frac{C_{payments}}{C_{clicks}}$</p>|0.0075|0.1093125|\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, $\\displaystyle \\text{Retention} = \\frac{\\text{Net conversion}}{\\text{Gross conversion}}$, so we probably don't need all 3 metrics, knowing any 2 metrics can calculate the 3rd one. Let's dig deeper and decide which one to be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"se\">3.3 Calculating Standard Error</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each metric we selected as an evaluation metric, make an analytic estimate of its standard error, given a sample size of **5000** cookies visiting the course overview page. Enter each estimate in the appropriate box to 4 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1**: Make sure use only the information given in the [Rough Estimates of the Baseline Values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0). Do not use [Test Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu5u9GrybDdska-ljPXyBjTpdZIUev_6i7t4LRDfXM8/edit#gid=0), since this step should be done before the experiment is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2**: Make sure to find out how many units of analysis will correspond to **5000** pageviews for each metric. Again, use the given [Rough Estimates of the Baseline Values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula\n",
    "The formula is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p \\cdot (1-p)}{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p$ is proportion of successes in the sample, $n$ is the number of observations in the sample, both values can be found in [Rough Estimates of the Baseline Values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0).\n",

Therefore, it's important to choose appropriate sample size to get a balance.\n",

    "- What if the decrease in Gross conversion is because some students don't like the Free Trial Screener?\n",
    "After all, it takes extra steps to finish the enrollment with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though Net conversion has no significant change, but it just indicates students pay after 14 days' free trial. We don't know the number of students who complete the course will be increased or decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can this change really improve the student experience? Right now we don't see any direct benefits from the test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, I would not recommend launching this Free Trial Screener feature for now. We need to understand the reason behind the decrease in Gross conversion, and we need concrete evidence shows the change is beneficial to Udacity, like improving the student experience or increasing revenue. Let's talk with other team members and the manager about our concerns."

    "### Requirement\n",
    "Give a high-level description of the follow up experiment you would run, what your hypothesis would be, what metrics you would want to measure, what your unit of diversion would be, and your reasoning for these choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the Design\n",
    "In this follow-up experiment, I would like to add a detailed introduction page for each instructor, and check if it can increase the click-through-probability on \"Enroll now\" button, that is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Enroll now\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. Here is the screeshot of course overview page with \"Enroll now\" button:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/Udacity-AB-Testing-Follow-Up-Experiment-Enroll-Button.png\" style=\"width:50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: After clicking \"Enroll now\" button, students need to enter the payment information. There is a 30 day free trial, after that, students will be charged automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, each instructor's introduction on the Udacity course overview page is short and very general. Therefore, users do not know how experienced those instructors are in this field, which makes the course less attractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changes that require A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a detailed introduction page for each instructor, with more details like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the instructor's field of expertise?\n",
    "- How many years has the instructor been working in this field?\n",
    "- The list of courses he/she instructs\n",
    "- User ratings of those courses\n",
    "\n",
    "And add a clickable link on the course overview page that can redirect users to that page. Here is the mock-up of course overview page:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Udacity-AB-Testing-Follow-Up-Experiment-Mockup-1.png\" style=\"width:75%\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Udacity-AB-Testing-Follow-Up-Experiment-Mockup-2.png\" style=\"width:75%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis is by adding detailed introduction pages of instructors, user will find those instructors more professional and find the course more credible. Therefore, it can increase the Click-through-probability of \"Enroll now\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit of Diversion\n",
    "Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invariant Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariant metrics are those happen before the experiment change is trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of cookies**: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min}=3000$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics of this follow-up experiment are very similar to those of Free Trial Screener experiment. Some additional evaluation metrics have been added because the number of clicks may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of clicks**: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Enroll now\" button. ($d_{min}=240$)\n",
    "- **Click-through-probability**: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Enroll now\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min}=0.01$)\n",
    "- **Number of user-ids**: That is, number of users who complete the checkout and enrollment process. ($d_{min}=50$)\n",
    "- **Gross conversion**: That is, number of user-ids to complete the checkout and enrollment, divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Enroll now\" button. ($d_min=0.01$)\n",
    "- **Retention**: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 30-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of user-ids to complete checkout. ($d_{min}=0.01$)\n",
    "- **Net conversion**: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 30-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Enroll now\" button. ($d_{min}=0.0075$)"
